**Projects Overview**

1. Data Exploration and Wealth Dynamics
2. 
Objective: Discover valuable insights and trends within diverse datasets related to global wealth dynamics using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.
Techniques: Utilize histograms, boxplots, correlation matrices, and data visualizations to gain a comprehensive understanding of wealth patterns and distributions.
3. Hypothesis Testing and Wealth Analysis
Objective: Investigate and validate hypotheses related to wealth dynamics across different economic contexts and factors.
Approaches: Employ Shapiro-Wilk tests, two-sample t-tests, normality assessments, and variance comparisons to examine wealth disparities and their contributing factors.

5. Regression Analysis for Wealth Modeling
6. 
Objective: Build robust regression models to analyze and predict the relationships between various variables and wealth distribution in different country contexts.
Methods: Utilize generalized linear models (GLM), correlation matrices, and regression diagnostics to uncover key factors influencing wealth accumulation and distribution.

8. Time Series Analysis for Wealth Forecasting
   
Objective: Perform sophisticated time series analysis techniques to analyze temporal trends, forecast future wealth dynamics, and identify patterns.
Methods: Apply Holt-Winters exponential smoothing, simple moving averages (SMA), ARIMA models, and residual analysis to gain insights into wealth trends and make informed predictions.
10. Additional Statistical Techniques for Wealth Analysis
Objective: Evaluate and validate model performance, forecast errors, and residuals to ensure the reliability of wealth analysis models.
Approaches: Examine forecast error distributions, conduct thorough residual analysis, and evaluate model performance to enhance the accuracy of wealth dynamics predictions.

12. Correlation Analysis of Wealth Components
    
Objective: Investigate the relationships between different wealth components and natural capital across various countries.
Techniques: Conduct correlation analysis to quantify the strength and direction of relationships, visualize results using correlation matrices and plots.

15. Regression Analysis for Developed and Developing Countries
    
Objective: Explore wealth predictors and conduct regression analysis for developed and developing countries.
Methods: Perform regression modeling to identify significant predictors of wealth and assess the impact of various factors in different economic contexts.

18. Time Series Modeling and Forecasting
    
Objective: Apply time series modeling techniques to analyze wealth and human capital datasets and forecast future trends.
Methods: Utilize Holt-Winters exponential smoothing, moving averages, and ARIMA modeling to capture patterns, make predictions, and assess forecast accuracy.
20. Focused Time Series Analysis for Nigeria
Objective: Delve into time series analysis of employed male and female human capital in Nigeria.
Techniques: Conduct stationarity testing, ARIMA modeling, and forecast analysis to understand trends, make predictions, and assess gender-specific dynamics.
